# Attempt at Lox Implementation(s)

## Rust-Lox

Rust-Lox is the major (and so far, the only committed) implementation of Lox.
It currently lacks two features: Super-calls, and a correct variable resolution phase, apparently.
Run it with `cargo run repl` or `cargo run source.lox`.

Rust docs are available under https://lox.gh.alnaya.moe/rust_lox/ and automatically provided by GitHub Pages.
